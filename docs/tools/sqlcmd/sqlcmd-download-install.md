# Download and install the sqlcmd utility

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance Azure Synapse Analytics PDW FabricSQLDB](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw-fabricsqldb.md)]

The [sqlcmd utility](sqlcmd-utility.md) lets you enter Transact-SQL statements, system procedures, and script files.

## sqlcmd variants

There are two variants of **sqlcmd**:

- **sqlcmd** (Go): The `go-mssqldb`-based **sqlcmd**, sometimes styled as **go-sqlcmd**. This version is a standalone tool you can download independently of [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. It runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and in containers.

- **sqlcmd** (ODBC): The platform-aligned, ODBC-based **sqlcmd**, available with [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or the Microsoft Command Line Utilities, and part of the `mssql-tools` package on Linux. It also runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and in containers.

## Download and install sqlcmd (Go)

**sqlcmd** (Go) can be installed cross-platform, on Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux. Versions newer than 1.6 might not be available in all package managers. There's no estimated date yet for their availability.

## Download and install sqlcmd (ODBC)

**sqlcmd** (ODBC) can be installed cross-platform, on Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### [Windows](#tab/windows)

Download the command line utilities for Windows, using the following table.

| Driver | Platform |
| --- | --- |
| Microsoft Command Line Utilities 15 for SQL Server | [x64](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2230791)&emsp;[x86](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2231320) |

The command line tools are General Availability (GA), however they are also released with the installer package for [!INCLUDE [sql-server-2019](../../includes/sssql19-md.md)] and later versions.

#### Version information

- Release number: 15.0.4298.1
- Build number: 15.0.4298.1
- Release date: April 7, 2023

> [!NOTE]  
> The **sqlcmd** download provided here might not have the same release and build number as **sqlcmd** installed with the latest SQL Server cumulative update (CU). This behavior is expected. This version contains all the fixes included in the latest CU.

**sqlcmd** (ODBC) supports authentication with [Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/new-name), including multifactor authentication (MFA) support for Azure SQL Database, Azure Synapse Analytics, and Always Encrypted features.

#### System requirements

- Windows 10 and later versions
- Windows Server and later versions

This component requires both the built-in [Windows Installer 5](/windows/win32/msi/what-s-new-in-windows-installer-5-0) and the [Microsoft ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server](../../connect/odbc/download-odbc-driver-for-sql-server.md).

### [macOS](#tab/mac)

See [Install the sqlcmd and bcp SQL Server command-line tools on Linux](../../linux/sql-server-linux-setup-tools.md) for instructions to install **sqlcmd** on macOS.

### [Linux](#tab/linux)

See [Install the sqlcmd and bcp SQL Server command-line tools on Linux](../../linux/sql-server-linux-setup-tools.md) for instructions to install **sqlcmd** on macOS.

## Preinstalled

You can also find **sqlcmd** preinstalled in certain environments.

### Azure Cloud Shell

You can try the **sqlcmd** utility from Azure Cloud Shell, as it's preinstalled by default.

[Launch Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com)

### Azure Data Studio

To run SQLCMD statements in [Azure Data Studio](/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio), select **Enable SQLCMD** from the editor toolbar.

### SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

To run SQLCMD statements in [SQL Server Management Studio](/ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms) (SSMS), navigate to **Query** > **SQLCMD Mode**.

SSMS uses the Microsoft [!INCLUDE [dnprdnshort-md](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] `SqlClient` for execution in regular and SQLCMD mode in **Query Editor**. When **sqlcmd** is run from the command-line, **sqlcmd** uses the ODBC driver. Because different default options could apply, you might see different behavior when you execute the same query in SSMS in SQLCMD mode and in the **sqlcmd** utility.
